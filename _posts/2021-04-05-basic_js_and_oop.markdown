### What is OOP?
Object Oriented Programming is a programming language classification that relies on the use of classes and objects. This is one of the more common programming paradigms used today in languages such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby and many others. The principle feature that makes this paradigm so popular is each object's ability to capsulate procedures and modify it's own. 

### What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is an Object Oriented Programming language that is used to create webpages and make them interactive. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. 

### What is a Server?
A server is piece of computer hardware that provides functionality for devices or programs called 'clients'. It accepts and responds to requests made by these clients as they ask for information, updates, modifications or deletions. Essentially, it is a piece of compueter hardware that provides information for other computers. 
### What is ECMAScript?
ECMAScript is a general-purpose programming language, standardised by Ecma International according to the document ECMA-262. It is a JavaScript standard meant to ensure the interoperability of Web pages across different Web browsers. 

### What are JavaScript Frameworks?
JavaScript frameworks are an essential part of modern front-end web development, providing developers with tried and tested tools for building scalable, interactive web applications. One of the more modern examples is React.JS, a Facebook maintenanced JavaScript library that is used to build user interfaces and UI. Another popular example is Vue.JS, a front-end JavaScript framework created and maintenanced by Evan You that is used to create user interfaces and single-page applications.

I really hope this helps new programmers get a kick start on their JavaScript Journey. This information is available with more in depth explanations, examples, and descriptions on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). Thank you!
