Theres TONS of different little ways to make your coding faster on Visual Studio Code. Not just faster, but easier and more manageable. For Mac users, here are a few that I use to be able to meet deadlines and learning goals!

* ⌘P (MacOS) | Ctrl+P (Windows): To open the command palette to open a file or activate a feature. You are probably using this one ALL THE TIME.

* ⇧⌘O (MacOS) | Ctrl+Shift+O (Windows): The day I discovered this one and understood what "Go to Symbol..." meant, the countless moments I should've used it starting flashing by... 😻 Anyways! This feature allows accessing any function or variable in the file you initially declared at. See what I mean now? Your debugging experience just became a little sweeter buddy! 😼

* ⌃- / ⌃⇧- (MacOS) | Alt+ ← / → (Windows): Wanna move up and down from two specific locations in a breeze? We got ya! With these two navigation shortcuts (Go back / Go forward), you can do so. 😁

* ⌃G (MacOS) | Ctrl+G (Windows): One more for the road, this one gets you right to the line number you need to edit.

#### Move or Duplicate a Line, Up or Down
* ⌥↓ / ⌥↑ (MacOS) | Alt+ ↑ / ↓ (Windows): Moves a line or a selection up or down from where your selector is positioned.

* ⇧⌥↓ / ⇧⌥↑ (MacOS) | Shift+Alt + ↓ / ↑ (Windows): A bit similar to the last one in the sense that it copies a line or a selection AND THEN pastes it below or above where you positioned your cursor.

As I find more, I'll post more to share, thank you for reading!
