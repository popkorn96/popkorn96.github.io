This post won't be as technical as the others, rather more of a checkpoint on my journey as a developer. <br><br>
Starting this journey, I remember being at a loss for words when I began to see the* vocabulary, terminal*, and even just different* commands*. Simple things like *variables* seemed like such foundational concepts that I did not want to mess up my understanding. I had gone to college for the better part of my adult life and learned by repetition and memorization. Standardized tests were always what I had to pass in order to advance. Learning how to code, however, required a very different approach. Instead of taking regular notes in my books or highlighting text, I had to do much more, not in terms of note taking, but in terms of action. <br><br>
Looking back, I remember my fear and my uncertainty but most of all my **excitement**. Ruby was an excellent gateway to the world of development and I would learn it all over again the same way. <br><br>
Today I can say it has been one of the most enriching learning experiences of my life. I don't know if I would have been cabable of learning what I did without structure. I could've chosen from a variety of bootcamps but Flatiron seemed like the right fit. I am learning more and more each day from different types of databases, to languages, to frameworks and libraries.<br><br>
Currently, there is a **grand** demand for software engineers but breaking that wall, getting that foot in the door, has been the most difficult thing to accomplish. Even adapting ot algorithms to prepare for interviews hasn't been as difficult as landing my first offer. My resume has allowed me to receive offers for positions in customer service and logistics, but my intuition insists on pursuing develompent. As tempting as it is to throw in the towel, I cannot give into that fear of not finding a job. Many senior software engineers have testified that landing that first position is the hardest part. They also say that it gets much easier after landing your first. I am eager and I am commited. Not only does my lifelihood depend on this, but my future with my fiance as well. We have many plans but it all depends on finding a job in these next few months. From networking to drafting custom cover letters for every company I apply for, I am trying my best and I know I'll start working somewhere soon! <br><br>
