There's so much that can be said about how much my understanding of code has changed the way I look at the world. The way our technology works is no longer as big of a mystery as it was before. The terminology, environment and versatiliy make it such a large creative outlet that the rendered efforts make so much possible. I know technology can only go so far but as a tool it's one of the greater one's I have in my arsenal in this drastically changing world.<br>

Personally I have always had a strong background in music and performance but I always knew that there were greater challenges and goals I could hope for and coding was never something I thought I could do. For the longest, I thought only the boldest and brightest would be the ones to push those programming frontiers, but watching earn their knowledge and use it to their advantage was something I could most definitely do. I decided to stop being afraid of the work and the grit I didn't think I had to be able to complete this course, but I am four months in and ready to finish this strong not only with a certification, but with a new outlook to life. A business degree wasn't going to make me happy and a career in logistics was not going to let me be creative with solutions or even challenging. <br>

While my family may not understand what it is exactly that I am doing and what I am working towards, it is enough for me to know that I will have taken the first steps to making my mark on the inter-webs. I can be me and I can be creative and I can find new challenges and most importantly, I can work to better my knowledge and go forward into this age of tech!<br>![](https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/124168339_5242082529150549_8716806408019154718_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=2&_nc_sid=a4a2d7&_nc_ohc=3LVeQCt1uN4AX9NR9Lz&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.xx&oh=96c116c70f921551cf72a28a159508b0&oe=5FD9AD27)
