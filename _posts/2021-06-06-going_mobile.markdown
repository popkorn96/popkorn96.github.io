There have been things working out for my latest project recently. Meeting with clients, refactoring and looking for options for deployment have been things I have been able to process with others to be able to meet the clients expectations. But what happens when a website is just the first step ? <br/<br/>
My client has decided that a mobile app would be really beneficial for the business they are running. More specifically, as a non-profit, there are different branches of organization that need to juggle different needs from the community. To increase outreach and productivity, the people I've been in contact in managerial positions strongly suggest that we try and develop a mobile app for android and IOS. <br/><br/>
But here's the thing -- I have absolutely no experience in developing for mobile. To be honest, though, that is not going to stop me from trying. Thankfully and luckily, the client I work with has no rush to deploy and has yet to establish parameters for the app. I was transparent in my experience with mobile and they were more than understanding and decided to let me take a shot at it. They have many opportunities for volunteer work and I have been a volunteer for years and I believe that this is why they had faith that I could complete this project in the coming months. The only specification that they gave was that they didn't want there to be too many updates or bugs that needed to be constantly fixed, so for this project I will be focusing primarily on immutable objects and consistent code. I take pride in my work and this will be a tough journey to take on but I am confident that I can give it a good go.<br/><br/>
For now I'm going to work on the IOS backend and try to see what all I am going to create as far as database and objects go. 
### Essential Technical Skills for iOS Developers
These skills include programming languages, development tools, and other programming concepts.

* Swift: Swift is the main programming language used for iOS development. This is a modern programming language that is easy to learn and receives frequent updates. A successful iOS developer should have a good understanding of Swift and its core concepts.
* UIKit: UIKit is a framework that helps iOS developers design their user interfaces. UIKit includes features to implement gestures, animations, default components, and haptic touch control into applications.
* Xcode: Xcode is an application developed by Apple to make it easy to write applications for any Apple device. As an iOS developer, you should be able to navigate your way through Xcode and understand the various features in the tool.

This is the start of a whole other aspect of my coding journey and I am excited as heck!
