I was previously working in a logistics firm located in uptown Dallas when I came accross a video on the internet. It showed a Flatiron Alumni from California who shared the aftermath of her hard work and dedication while studying at Flatiron. Completely unscripted as it was, I found that video by chance on TikTok! Her journey piqued my curiousity so I followed her on TikTok and YouTube as she had other videos further describing her experience and her current employment opportunities. Thinking that someone could ever decide to change their carreers because of a 15 second internet video is almost preposterous but, it happened!

I was already thinking of changing my major in college to something more suited to my talents and my thirst for challenge and as exciting as Business Administration would have been, I know it doesn't allow for much creativity. What really clicked for me with the prospect of software development is the virtually unlimited access to boundless resources and the engaging and encouraging community it resides in. It's definitely been a challenging first week, learning a new language in 5 months will be an accomplishment of a lifetime but I would say with Flatiron's support, I am ready to tackle this opportunity head on!
