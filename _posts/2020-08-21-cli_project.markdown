I got through it! I got it to work! - These were my first thoughts whenever I first got my CLI project to work and it felt incredible, knowing that I was able to implement the things I've been learning for the past few weeks into a personalized project with functionality was honestly one of the proudest moments of my life, there was nothing to bring my mood down since then. For those of you just starting the project out, please don't ovethink your solutions, there are many resources online that help you understand methods like scraping or looping if you haven't fully grasped those yet, and many others.
Starting this project with a clear idea of what I wanted the app to do was key to getting the ball rolling and getting everything in its place. Scraping was challenging at first but once you grasp the concept and retrieval proceedures you can definitely get it done and this experience will help in a long run as well. I HIGHLY recommend testing out your code as you go, I personally used the REPL.it site to verify that my scraping was on the right track and I used PRY to make sure my code was okay. The project was a very rewarding experience and while it was nerve wrecking at first, I was proud of my end result!
