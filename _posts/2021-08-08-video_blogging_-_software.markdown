While it's been tempting to create my own software for video editing, I found some great apps and software that could help me get started with video blogging!

I've added some details for 5 below, there's more resources and details that can be found online for each, but these are the ones I'm considering to use for my future blogging projects!



#### 1. Animoto
Animoto’s drag-and-drop editor makes it painless to create impressive videos for your editorial content, promotional campaigns, and social ads. Now, you can share what matters most to your fans.

The platform lets you choose pre-built storyboards, or you can start from scratch.  Animoto teamed up with Getty Images to offer users access to a high-quality stock library. You’ll gain inspiration to turn your footage into a creative masterpiece.

 

#### 2. Hyperlapse
Hyperlapse empowers you to make jaw-dropping time lapse videos without buying any expensive equipment. It’s your chance to transform any long process into a 30 second spot.

Back in the day, this type of video was a clunky endeavor. You needed a tripod or a tool to keep the camera steady. The Hyperlapse app gives you cinematic quality with automatic stabilization.

 

#### 3. Powtoon
Video isn’t limited to you hopping in front of a camera every day. There’s also the choice of using ready-made characters and design.

That’s where Powtoon steps in. This video tool lets you create animated presentations and animated explainer videos. With access to royalty-free footage and music, you have the control to craft something truly different for your audience.

 

#### 4. Adobe Premiere Clip
As a novice, you’re probably not going to shoot ever video perfectly. So, you need a tool to help you edit out any unwanted footage. Adobe Premiere Clip polishes your mistakes and turns your finished video into a work of art.

It’s a powerful editing platform where you can drag and drop clips, adjust the exposure, and even out your audio levels. Need to spruce things up? You also can insert titles, transitions, and slo-mo effects.
 

#### 5. Loom
Loom is one of my personal favorites. This app makes it convenient to capture your screen and record with your front-facing camera. In a few clicks, you can share your video with a unique link.

It’s useful when you desire to do an impromptu video for your blog fans. Let’s say you want to send a personable message to a few readers. With this browser app, you can record when you feel comfortable without any cumbersome setups.



#### SPECIAL!! Canva
A video without an attractive thumbnail gets scanned over by visitors. Your goal is to prevent that from happening, and Canva offers a solution.

With this graphic design tool, you can produce a thumbnail highlighting the purpose of any video. Using a colorful, clean image means more clicks for your blog.

I personally use Canva for just about everything creative and that needs to be viewed by the public like logos, posters, banners, flags, seriously *anyhthing creative! 

I hope this helps aspiring content creators such as myself, catch everyone on the flip side!
