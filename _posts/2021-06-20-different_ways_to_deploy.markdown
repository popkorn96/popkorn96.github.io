The client and team I am currently working with are all about ready to get this project deployed. The bigger question is, how will we be going about it? There are many different ways to deploy and some even local to Github that support static pages. However, the project we are fixing to deploy is most definitely not static. <br><br>
Multiple services are available at a larger scale that are better tailored for large scale projects. Here are some of the most popular services currently available: 

* Amazon Web Services (AWS) has made huge waves in the past few years by providing numerous hosting options and a highly customizable experience. 
* Microsoft’s Azure is ridiculously popular, too, as its pay-as-you-go pricing model and top tier scalability make it an easy choice.
* If you’re looking for bare bones hosting and super cheap prices, Low End Box offers just that. <br><br>

I have a personal attachment to DigitalOcean, one of the smaller fish (hehe) in this list. DigitalOcean’s extensive documentation and welcoming community make it an easy choice for me.<br><br>
Beyond these choices, there is also the questions regarding DNS, domain authority, and others. <br><br>There's even a mailing feature you could add depending on your DNS configuration. It was something I had done for this company before, but through a third party website building app, but now as I understand the construction side of software, I'm confident our delpoyment will be a success!
